        <p>
            In a vortex of complete chaos and nothingness, a single Egg comes into being, which then hatches into Arceus, the first Pokémon
            in existence. Arceus then creates Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, giving them power over time, space, and antimatter
            respectively. Giratina, as punishment for its destructive nature, is sent by Arceus to live in the Distortion
            World. Dialga and Palkia then succeed in creating the universe and Pokémon world and retreat into their own dimensions
            afterwards, with a point of access being at the ancient Spear Pillar in Sinnoh. Arceus creates Uxie, Mesprit,
            and Azelf, giving knowledge, emotion, and willpower to all living things that come into existence in the Pokémon
            world. The three dive into caves at the bottom of Lake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuityin Sinnoh, giving them
            the name "lake guardians". Kyogre is formed by the pressure in the deep sea trenches, Groudon is formed deep
            inside the Earth, likely from hardened magma and earth, and Rayquaza is formed by the minerals of the ozone layer.
            Rayquaza proceeds to fly around in the ozone layer, occasionally coming to rest at Sky Pillar. Kyogre and Groudon
            then proceed to fill the sea and create land, respectively. A chance meeting turns the two into rivals, and a
            conflict for dominance over the Pokémon world begins. This battle continues until Rayquaza quells it, causing
            Kyogre and Groudon to retreat to special caverns, where they rest until the events of Generation III many years
            later. The Red and Blue Orbs are created to prevent the reawakening of Kyogre and Groudon, and are left at Mt.
            Pyre for safekeeping. At this time, Mew may have been plentiful and lived in large numbers. Landmasses such as
            Mt. Coronet are created, and Regigigas moves the continents, forming the regions, and creates the three titans,
            Regirock, Regice, and Registeel, out of clay, ice, and magma, respectively. The Sinnoh region is created around
            Mt. Coronet. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain is created due to shifts in the crust of the world
            and Heatran is formed in a pool of lava. Arceus creates the Adamant, Lustrous, and Griseous Orbs before falling
            into a deep slumber.
